Customers can view and manage their licenses in the Keyforge portal. To access it, customers can request an email with a link to the portal. All licenses linked to their email address will be available.

<Callout title="Hide products">
  If you prefer not to make your products available for customers to manage in
  the portal, you can hide them in the
  [dashboard](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/portal). You can also prevent
  customers from resetting active devices.

### Private sessions

You can also create a private portal session for a specific email address via the [dashboard](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/portal) or [API](/api-reference/portal/create-private-session). Customers will only be able to view and manage licenses from your products. The generated link is valid for 12 hours.
