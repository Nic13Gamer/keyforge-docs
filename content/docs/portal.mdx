Customers can view and manage their licenses in the Keyforge portal. To access it, customers can request an email with a link to the portal. All licenses linked to their email address will be available.

  If you do not want to have your products available for customers to manage in
  the portal, you can do so in the
  [dashboard](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/portal). You can also not allow
  customers to reset the devices of their licenses in the portal.
