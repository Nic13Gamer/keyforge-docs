A product is a software or service that you want to license and distribute to your customers.

## Perpetual fallback

When enabled on a product, timed licenses that have expired will still be valid, but shown as limited. You decide how to limit your product's functionality based on your needs. The status returned by the API for these licenses is `fallbacked`.

<Callout>
  This feature is recommended to be used together with [license
  renewals](/addons/payment/updates?type=renewal) to give your customers a way
  to extend their licenses after expiration.

## Customization

### Support email

A customer support email displayed in purchase emails and the portal. It's optional, but if not provided, customers will be instructed to contact you through your Keyforge account email.

### Purchase note

A note displayed in purchase emails and the portal, usually to guide customers on how to activate their license.

### Action button

A button displayed in purchase emails and the portal, usually used as a download button. You can define its text and link.

<Callout>
  You can add the license key to the action button link by using the `{key}`
  placeholder. For example, `https://example.com/download?key={key}`.
