Everything in Keyforge revolves around products. A product is a software or service that you want to license and distribute to your customers.

Every product needs a name, can have a description and a customer support email.

## Support email

The customer support email is displayed to your customers and allows them to contact you in case they have any questions or issues with your product. It is not required, but strongly recommended. If you don't provide a support email, your customers will be instructed to contact you through your Keyforge account email.
