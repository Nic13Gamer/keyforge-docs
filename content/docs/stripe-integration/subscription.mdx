Keyforge integrates with Stripe for automatic license generation. No code or webhook setup needed.

Upon subscribing to a Stripe product, a license is automatically created on Keyforge, and the customer receives a thank you email with the license key.

Make sure you have a Stripe account, a recurring product set up on Stripe, and a corresponding product on Keyforge.

### License expiration & renewals

Licenses are **timed** and expire if the subscription isn't renewed. The expiration date updates automatically when an invoice is paid.

### Subscription management

#### Changing plans

If customers switch plans in the Stripe billing portal, ensure each plan has a connected corresponding Keyforge product. The license will be updated accordingly.

#### Plan quantity

For plans with a quantity greater than 1, the license **maximum active devices** will be multiplied by the quantity.

#### Disconnecting & unlinking

- Removing a connected Stripe subscription won't stop license updates on renewal.
- To **unlink a subscription** from a license, do so on the licenses page, but note that the license will no longer update on renewal, and the customer may continue paying.

### Free Trials

You can offer free trials by setting them up in Stripe. No change is needed on Keyforge.
