  Keyforge uses Stripe restricted API keys with only the necessary permissions.
  The secret keys are securely stored and encrypted using AES-256.

Keyforge integrates with Stripe payments to allow auto license generation. No code or webhook setup needed. This guide explains how to set up the integration.

After purchasing a Stripe product, a license will be automatically created on Keyforge and the customer will receive a thank you email with the license key.

Before starting, make sure you have a Stripe account and a Stripe product set up, as well as a product created on Keyforge.

<Callout type="warn" title="Timed licenses">
  Be careful with timed licenses. If a customer purchases a timed license that
  has already expired, they will get an inactive license that **will not work**.

## You're done! ðŸŽ‰

It's as simple as that! Create a payment link for your Stripe product and start selling. When a customer purchases the product, a license will be automatically created on Keyforge and they will get emailed the license key.
