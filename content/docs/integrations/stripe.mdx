  Keyforge uses Stripe restricted API keys with only the necessary permissions.
  The secret keys are securely stored and encrypted using AES-256.

Keyforge integrates with Stripe for auto license generation. No code or webhook setup needed.

Upon purchasing a Stripe product, a license is automatically created on Keyforge, and the customer receives a thank you email with the license key.

Make sure you have a Stripe account, a product set up on Stripe, and a corresponding product on Keyforge.

### Timed licenses

You can choose between two options for creating timed licenses using the Stripe integration:

1. **Offset**: The expiration date of the license will be set to the creation date plus the defined offset.
2. **Fixed**: All created licenses will share the same expiration date, as specified in the options.

<Callout type="warn" title="Fixed timed licenses">
  If a customer purchases a fixed timed license that has already expired, they
  will get an inactive license that **will not work**.
</Callout>

### Invoices

If you enable invoice generation in the Stripe payment link, customers will be able to download their invoice from the [portal](/portal). You can also download the invoice from the dashboard.
