You can setup Keyforge in your project within minutes. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started. You will create your first license, activate it, and then validate it.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have completed the following steps:

- Create an API key [here](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/api-keys).
- Create a product [here](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/products).

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install

Install the Keyforge Node.js SDK.

```package-install
keyforge-js
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a license

Create a license for your product. In this example, we will create a license that never expires and can only have 1 device active at the same time. The license key will be logged to the console, copy it.

```js
import { Keyforge } from 'keyforge-js';

const keyforge = new Keyforge('<YOUR_API_KEY>');

const license = await keyforge.licenses.create({
  productId: '<YOUR_PRODUCT_ID>',
  type: 'perpetual',
  maxDevices: 1,
});

console.log(license.key);
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Activate a license

Activate the license you have just created. Replace `LICENSE_KEY` with the license key you copied in the previous step. In this example, we will active the license on a device with the identifier `some_device_id` and the name `My computer name`.

```js
await keyforge.licenses.activate('LICENSE_KEY', {
  identifier: 'some_device_id',
  name: 'My computer name',
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Validate a license

Validate the license you have just activated. Replace `LICENSE_KEY` with the license key. In this example, we will validate the license on the device with the identifier `some_device_id` and see if it's valid.

```js
const validation = await keyforge.licenses.validate('LICENSE_KEY', {
  deviceIdentifier: 'some_device_id',
});

console.log(validation.isValid);
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Congratulations!

You have successfully created, activated, and validated your first license. Your licenses are also available in the [dashboard](https://keyforge.dev/dashboard/licenses).
