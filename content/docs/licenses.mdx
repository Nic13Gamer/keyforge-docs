Keyforge provides a simple licensing management system for your products, allowing you to distribute them easily, securely and without wasting time building your own licensing solution.

Each license is associated with a product and can be activated on a defined number of devices. A license can also have an email associated with it, allowing customers to manage their licenses in the [portal](/portal).

## License types

Keyforge currently supports two types of licenses:

- **Perpetual**: A license that never expires.
- **Timed**: A license that expires at a specific date.

## Devices

A license can be activated on multiple devices, as defined by the maximum active devices.

Each active device on a license has 3 properties:

- **Identifier**: A unique identifier for the device. Must have at most 64 characters.
- **Name**: A name for the device. Does not need to be unique. Must have at most 64 characters.
- **Activation date**: The date when the device was activated.

<Callout title="Device identifier">
  The device identifier needs to be unique inside the license scope. There are
  various ways to get a unique identifier, such as the MAC address, HWID, serial
  number, or a randomly generated UUID stored in the device.

## License status

When validating a license, you get the status of the license. It can be one of the following:

- **Active**: The license is active and can be used.
- **Expired**: The license has expired and is no longer valid.
- **Revoked**: The license has been revoked and is invalid.

<Callout type="warn">
  A license can have the status `active` and still not be valid. For example, if
  you validate for a certain device and product ID, and the license is not valid
  for that device or product ID. Learn more about validating a license
  [here](/api-reference/licenses/validate).
