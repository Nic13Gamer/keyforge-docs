It's common to have apps that need to work even without an internet connection. Keyforge makes it easy to validate licenses oflline.

To make this possible, Keyforge can issue a signed **license token** that is verified on the client. The token is a JWT and contains information about the license.

  An internet connection is only required to activate the license and to
  occasionally refresh the license token.

## Getting started

There is a client SDK available for JavaScript, but license tokens can be used in any programming language that supports JWTs.
